# Terms of service Generator
AI Generated Terms of service

Based on [Articles from tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation) and [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

## Disclaimer
This is my first functioning neural network besides those I learned from tutorials.  
It might contain dirty dataset, poorly set hyperparameters and models in local minima.

## Abstract

Neural network can generate convincing texts.  
It can learn simple words, text formats and even grammatical structures from examples.  
But sadly, results doesn't convey any meaning as current technology, specifically RNN-based neural network cannot learn contextual informations.  
There might be some bleeding edge technology that can generate meaningful texts I don't know yet, but who cares?  
It's terms of service no one reads.

Target Circle Loyalty Program
Target Circle is a loyalty program. By joining or using Target Circle you agree to these Target Circle Terms. Target may update the Target Circle Terms or make any changes to the Target App or to the Site at any time without notice. You agree to any updates to the Target Circle Terms by continuing to participate in the program.

In the Target Circle Terms, these words are defined as follows:

Target Circle is a loyalty program offered by Target Corporation.

Target Circle Terms are these terms that govern the Target Circle program.

Target Circle Earnings are rewards which can be earned by Target Circle members by making purchases with non-RedCard payment types.

Community Giving Program is the program which provides Target Circle members the opportunity to earn and cast votes to help direct where Target makes its Donation to Nonprofits.

Nonprofits are the nonprofit organizations selected by Target for the Community Giving Program.

Donation is the charitable donation Target makes to Nonprofits in the Community Giving Program.

Voting Period is the time period during which Target Circle members can cast votes for Nonprofits in the Community Giving Program.

Receiving Target Circle Benefits

When you are a Target Circle member, in order to receive, earn and redeem all the Target Circle benefits, you need to provide your first and last name and a valid email address in your Target account. In order to receive birthday rewards, you also need to provide your birthday in your Target Circle account.

To earn Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes, you must identify yourself as a Target Circle member when you make a purchase at Target. When you make a purchase in Target stores, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout by entering your mobile telephone number, scanning the Wallet barcode in the Target App, or paying with the RedCard connected to your Target Circle account. You need to provide a valid United States mobile telephone number in your Target account if you want to use your mobile telephone number to identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout. You need to connect your debit or credit RedCard to your Target Circle account if you want to use your RedCard to identify yourself as a Target Circle member at checkout. If you do not identify yourself as a Target Circle member in the store at checkout, you can identify yourself later by using the Target App to scan your purchase receipt barcode up to 7 days after a making an eligible purchase. When you make a purchase on Target.com or in the Target App, you can identify yourself as a Target Circle member by signing in to your Target account before you place your order.

For in-store transactions, if you identify yourself as a Target Circle member in a single transaction using multiple identification methods (e.g. provide your telephone number and pay with your connected RedCard) that are not associated with the same Target Circle account, Target Circle benefits will be awarded to and/or redeemed from only one of the associated Target Circle accounts, which will be determined at Target’s sole discretion.

You can connect your debit or credit RedCard to your Target Circle account to participate in certain Target Circle offers and programs. After your RedCard is connected, when you use your RedCard to make purchases at Target, you will receive Target Circle transaction benefits, including Community Giving Program votes, but you will not earn Target Circle Earnings rewards. You will receive the RedCard 5% discount on eligible purchases (see Target.com/RedCard for the 5% discount program rules) instead of Target Circle Earnings rewards. Each RedCard can only be connected to one Target Circle account.

Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes do not expire as long as you are actively participating in the Target Circle program. Target Circle Earnings rewards will expire if you have not earned or redeemed any Target Circle Earnings rewards for one year. If you do not participate in Target Circle for more than one year, Target reserves the right to expire any uncast Community Giving Program votes and/or delete your Target Circle account without notice to you. Neither Target Circle Earnings rewards nor Community Giving Program votes will be reinstated if they expire. Community Giving Program votes may expire before the end of any particular Voting Period.

One Target Circle membership is permitted per guest. Your membership and any Target Circle benefits, including Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes, are non-transferable and are subject to future Target Circle Terms. Neither Target Circle Earnings rewards nor Community Giving Program votes can be combined or transferred between Target or Target Circle accounts.

Target Circle may be used only for personal, family and household purposes. You agree that you will not use Target Circle for business or commercial purposes. Resellers are expressly excluded from Target Circle. If you purchase items in violation of these terms, including resale, Target reserves the right to not award Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes, to deduct improperly awarded Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes, and/or to terminate your participation in Target Circle.

If you enroll or participate in Target Circle using an invalid telephone number, such as a toll free number, international telephone number, invalid area code or invalid exchange, Target reserves the right to delete Target Circle Earnings rewards, Community Giving Program votes and any other Target Circle benefit associated with the invalid telephone number. Target will not reinstate any deleted Target Circle Earnings rewards, Community Giving Program votes or other Target Circle benefits if a valid telephone number is subsequently provided.

Additional bonus offer opportunities may be available for some Target Circle members in some or all markets, at the sole and absolute discretion of Target, and will be available through the Target App and Target.com/circle. The communication about any bonus offer opportunity will include additional terms and conditions, if applicable. Go to Target.com/circle and sign in to see any offers available to you.

Opting out of Target Circle and forfeiture of Target Circle Benefits.

If you no longer wish to be a Target Circle Member, you can opt out of Target Circle here.

If you opt out of Target Circle, any accumulated Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes will be deleted and you may not have access to other Target Circle benefits. If you later re-join Target Circle, any deleted Target Circle Earnings rewards or Community Giving Program votes will not be reinstated.

If you or Target delete, suspend or close your Target Circle account or your Target account, any accumulated Target Circle Earnings rewards and Community Giving Program votes will be deleted and you may not have access to other Target Circle benefits. Any deleted Target Circle Earnings rewards or Community Giving Program votes will not be reinstated. In the event of any abusive or fraudulent activity related to Target Circle, and/or any violation of Target Circle terms, as determined in our sole discretion, Target reserves the right to make any adjustments to your Target Circle account and/or terminate your participation in Target Circle at any time.

If you enroll or participate in Target Circle using an invalid telephone number, such as a toll free number, international telephone number, invalid area code or invalid exchange, Target reserves the right to delete Target Circle Earnings rewards, Community Giving Program votes and any other Target Circle benefit associated with the invalid telephone number. Target will not reinstate any deleted Target Circle Earnings rewards, Community Giving Program votes or other Target Circle benefits if a valid telephone number is subsequently provided.

Target reserves the right to change, limit, modify or terminate Target Circle, the Target Circle Terms, and/or your membership, for any or no reason, at any time, with or without notice.

1% Target Circle Earnings Reward

As a member of Target Circle, every time you use a non-RedCard form of payment and identify yourself as a Target Circle member, you earn Target Circle Earnings rewards at a rate of 1% of the eligible purchase amount minus the value of any promotions, discounts, coupons and Target Circle Earnings reward redemptions.

Target Circle Earnings rewards can only be redeemed for merchandise or services at Target. Target Circle Earnings rewards have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.

You will not earn Target Circle Earnings rewards on purchases if you use both a RedCard and a non-RedCard form of payment on a single purchase.

Target may provide Target Circle members and/or RedCard holders the opportunity to earn bonus Target Circle Earnings rewards. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the Target Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the Target Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity.

Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App are eligible to earn Target Circle Earnings rewards.

Target Circle Earnings rewards are not earned on the following:

Other restrictions may apply to earning Target Circle Earnings rewards.

To redeem Target Circle Earnings rewards you will need a Target account, including your telephone number if you joined Target Circle by providing your telephone number. Once your Target account profile is complete, you can redeem Target Circle Earnings. To redeem on your next purchase in Target Stores, elect to apply the Target Circle Earnings reward in your Target Circle account, and then either provide your mobile telephone number or scan your Wallet in the Target App during checkout. To redeem on Target.com, apply the Target Circle Earnings reward to your next online order during checkout on Target.com or the Target App.

When you elect to redeem Target Circle Earnings rewards, the entire amount will be applied to your next purchase as a Target discount. You cannot elect to redeem only a portion of your Target Circle Earnings rewards. If your purchase is less than the amount of the Target Circle Earnings rewards you have redeemed, the remaining amount may be unavailable for a second transaction until the first transaction has completed processing.

Target Circle Earnings rewards are applied to the total purchase amount after all other discounts have been applied to the purchase transaction, except that if you use your RedCard to pay for the purchase, any applicable RedCard 5% Discount will be applied to the transaction after the Target Circle Earnings rewards are redeemed.

Target Circle Earnings rewards cannot be redeemed for the following:

adult beverage purchases;
dairy product purchases;
purchases of prescriptions and over-the-counter items located behind the pharmacy counter;
purchases made at some partner businesses, including in-store clinics, Target Optical and Target Plus Partners;

where otherwise prohibited by law.
Other restrictions may apply to redeeming Target Circle Earnings rewards.

If items that earned Target Circle Earnings rewards are returned, the associated Target Circle Earnings rewards may be removed from your Target Circle Earnings rewards balance. If you have already redeemed Target Circle Earnings rewards on the returned items, Target reserves the right to take your Target Circle Earnings rewards to a negative balance (i.e. a balance of less than zero in your Target Circle account). In such event you will not have redeemable Target Circle Earnings rewards until the balance is greater than zero.

For Target Circle members who had a 1% earnings balance as of 9/4/2019, the unspent earnings were transferred to an eGiftCard which can be found in your Target account or in the Wallet in the Target App. The eGiftCard does not expire and can be redeemed for merchandise or services other than gift cards and prepaid cards at Target stores or on Target.com but cannot be redeemed for cash or credit except where required by law. View the eGiftCard for terms and conditions.

Community Giving Program

Target may run multiple local Community Giving Programs. By participating in Target Circle you have access to one Community Giving Program associated with your preferred store location as designated in your Target account settings. In each Community Giving Program, Target will make a Donation to be allocated among Nonprofits. Multiple store locations may be tied to a single Community Giving Program. The Nonprofits, Donation amount and Voting Period may vary by Community Giving Program. The allocation of the Donation among the Nonprofits for each Community Giving Program will be based on the percentage of votes each Nonprofit receives during the applicable Voting Period for that Community Giving Program. With respect to each Community Giving Program, the list of participating Nonprofits, the dates comprising the applicable Voting Period, and the Donation to be divided among the Nonprofits can be seen by logging on to and viewing the Target Circle voting screen on the Target App or at Target.com/circle.

As a member of Target Circle, every time you make an eligible purchase and identify yourself as a Target Circle member, you earn one vote. Only purchases made at Target stores or online at Target.com or in the Target App are eligible to earn Community Giving Program votes.

Votes are not earned on a purchase transaction that is comprised only of one or more of the following: Target Optical, in-store clinics, some partner businesses (including CVS), Target Subscription and Boxed Subscription purchases, gift cards, taxes, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges, payment of any RedCard account balance, payments for insufficient funds, prior purchases, or where otherwise prohibited by law.

To cast Community Giving Program votes, follow the instructions located under Target Circle benefits in your Target account via the Target App or Target.com/circle. You must have access to internet through your own device to participate. You must be a Target Circle member in good standing to participate. Votes have no cash value and do not represent an actual donation to any Nonprofit; rather, they are just the means to vote for allocation of the Donation from Target in each Community Giving Program. Target’s tally of votes is final. Each vote is intended for one-time use by you. If Target detects any inappropriate conduct related to votes or votes made outside the above guidelines, votes may be disregarded. In the event any aspect of Target Circle, including the voting, is disrupted in any way, Target reserves the right to allocate the Donation for any affected location in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by Target.

From time to time, Target may provide the opportunity to cast Community Giving Program votes to direct additional or supplemental Donations. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the Target Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the Target Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity.

Birthday Reward

When you include your birth date in your Target Circle account, on or near your birthday you will receive a birthday reward. The reward can be accessed either in the Target App or on Target.com. The reward will contain the full details on how to redeem the reward, and will include any applicable redemption restrictions and expiration date. Birthday rewards given will vary and are limited to one award per year per Target Circle account.

Target Circle Offers (formerly Cartwheel)

Target Circle includes an option to redeem coupons on products in Target Stores. To access Target Circle Offers, you must sign in to the Target App using your Target.com account.

Target Circle Offers are only valid in store, unless explicitly noted otherwise. No more than one manufacturer coupon (paper or digital), one Target coupon and one Target Circle Offer can be combined on any item. Each Target Circle Offer may be used for up to a maximum of 4 qualifying items per offer per transaction, unless otherwise noted. There is a limit of 1 Wallet barcode or telephone number redemption per transaction and 6 Wallet barcode or telephone number redemption transactions per day. Target Circle Offers cannot be applied with a price match. Target Circle Offers will be void if copied, scanned, altered, transferred, purchased, sold or prohibited by law. All Target Circle Offers may not be available at all stores due to product availability. The Target Circle Offer value may not exceed the value of the item purchased. All Target Circle Offers will have no cash value.

To redeem Target Circle Offers, you may use the Target App on your mobile device or a printout of your barcode. Photographs of barcodes will not be accepted. You may also redeem Target Circle Offers using the valid telephone number you provided for your Target account.

Target has the right to remove or cancel offers from Target Circle, and from your shopping list, at any time and for any reason without notice.

Only those Target Circle Offers that are on your saved offers list at the time of purchase can be redeemed. If you print your list and an offer expires or is canceled before you redeem the offer, that offer will not be valid.

For Target Circle Offers with a percentage discount, the actual dollar value may vary based on the item price at each store.

The numbers shown for total savings at the individual and global level for Target Circle Offers are specific to each account and do not reflect combined totals or the impact of any returns or exchanges that may be associated with those transactions.

All Target Circle Offers are subject to local and state laws and regulations. Such offers may be restricted or void in some locations. Target shall have no liability for the impact such laws or regulations may have on the ability to utilize such offers.

All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices described or depicted on Target Circle are subject to change at any time without notice.

Pricing, promotions and availability of items appearing in Target Circle Offers may vary by store location. Not all items are available in all markets. Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and Target shall have no liability of any kind for such errors.

Order Pickup and Drive Up
Some products offered on the Site are available for pickup in stores at the Guest Service counter or through our drive up service, including items shipped to a store of your choice for pickup in store. Not all items are available for this service nor is the pickup in store service or the drive up service available in all stores. Once your order is ready for pickup, you will be notified and charged for such item(s). We will notify you in the event that an item is unavailable at that store. If someone else will be picking up your order, you must designate him/her as an alternate pickup person when ordering. When picking up your drive up order, you will need your mobile phone to present the barcode associated with your order and sign for your order. When picking up your in-store order pickup, you or your alternate pickup person can use the pickup barcode associated with your order, or a valid government issued ID.

Target will hold your items for three days starting from the time that Target sends you the notice that your items are ready for pickup (“Original Time Window”). If your order has not been picked up within that time frame, you may elect to extend it for three additional days. This extension must occur before your Original Time Window expires. After three days (or six days if you chose to extend the Original Time Window), if you don’t pick up your order, your order will be canceled and you will be issued a refund for the items for which you were charged. In no event will orders be held for more than six days. Target reserves the right to limit the quantity of items ordered for pickup as well as the days of the year and daily hours that this service is offered.

If any problems arise with your subscription account, the shipping address or payment method connected with your subscription that Target is unable to resolve, we will notify you through the email address associated with your subscription and your subscription order may be canceled.

PayPal cannot be used for orders that include a subscription at this time.

The cost of each subscription order may vary. After your first order, the total cost for each subscription order will be the cost of the item on the day we send you an email notice confirming your subscription order plus sales tax, if any. Applicable discounts or promotions in effect at the time we confirm the price of your subscription order will be applied to your order.

After your first order, we will send you an email notice at least ten (10) days prior to processing each subscription order to confirm the cost and the shipping date of the subscription order. Your initial order will be processed when you set up the subscription. You can also view the amount of each subscription order by visiting Orders on your Target.com account and viewing the order details.

The amount of each subscription order will be billed to the credit card or Target Debit Card you authorize for Target Subscriptions purchases, and your card will be billed on the day your subscription order is shipped. If we are unable to complete an order with the credit card or Target Debit Card that you used to create your subscription, we will attempt to update the subscription with another credit card in your Target.com account and charge that credit card for your subscription order. If we successfully update your subscription with a different credit card, that credit card will be used for future subscription orders unless you change the payment method. If we are unable to complete a subscription order with an updated credit card, the order will be canceled or changed.

Automatic Renewal of Shipt Membership Fees
By authorizing Target to process your payment for a Shipt membership fee and Shipt membership fee renewals, you accept all of these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements.

When you sign up for an annual Shipt membership through Target.com, Target will process your payment for the first annual Shipt membership fee and after that will automatically process your payment each year for the Shipt membership fee renewal. Your Shipt membership will remain in effect until it is canceled.

The cost of a Shipt annual membership is disclosed at the time you sign up for a Shipt membership, and the fee is nonrefundable. If you were offered a free trial of a Shipt membership, you will need to contact Shipt to cancel your membership before the end of the free trial period to avoid being charged the membership fee. To prevent the automatic renewal of your annual Shipt membership fee, you must cancel your membership before the next annual membership fee is charged.

To cancel your membership, contact Shipt at (205) 502-2500 or send an email to xteam@shipt.com with your full name, phone number and e-mail address.

If there are changes related to the cost of the membership or if any problems arise with your payment method connected with your Shipt membership that Target is unable to resolve, we or Shipt will notify you through the email address associated with your Target.com account or your Shipt account. You will not be charged for a Shipt membership until the problem has been resolved, which may result in the cancellation or expiration of your Shipt membership.

Only valid credit cards or a Target Debit Card can be used to purchase a Shipt membership on Target.com. You cannot use a debit card, other than the Target Debit Card, to pay for a Shipt membership on Target.com. Target GiftCards may be used as payment for the initial Shipt membership purchase however, a valid credit card or Target Debit Card will still be required when you first sign up, and will be used to pay for membership renewals. PayPal cannot be used to pay for Shipt memberships at this time.

The amount of each annual Shipt membership fee renewal will be billed to the credit card or Target Debit Card you authorize for the initial Shipt membership purchase, and your card will be billed on the day your annual membership renews. If we are unable to process your payment for a membership fee renewal, your Shipt membership will not be renewed and will expire.

If you cancel your Target.com account, your Shipt membership fee will not be renewed and your Shipt membership will expire at the end of the current annual membership period.

You can view the details of your Shipt membership fee by visiting Orders in your Target.com account and viewing the order details. If you want to change or cancel the payment card you use for your Shipt membership fee, you can do so at any time by logging into My Account on Target.com, selecting Wallet and then edit or delete the payment card associated with your Shipt membership fee.

The terms of your membership are subject to Shipt’s terms (www.shipt.com/terms) and privacy policy (www.shipt.com/privacy). Contact Shipt directly at (205) 502-2500 with any questions about or issues with your Shipt membership.

All descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described or depicted on the Site are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures, and other descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. The inclusion of any products or services on the Site does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the receipt, possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from this Site. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. All DVDs and similar products sold are for private, non-public, home use (where no admission fee is charged) and may not be duplicated.

We will notify you if such limits are applied. Target reserves the right to prohibit purchases of any merchandise to resellers. Resellers are defined as a company or an individual that purchases goods with the intention of selling them rather than using them.

Colors
Target strives to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown on the Site; however, Target cannot and does not guarantee that your monitor’s display of any color will be accurate.

Availability, Errors & Inaccuracies
If an item is out of stock, Target or a Target Plus Partner, may, in its sole discretion and at no extra cost to you, substitute another item for the out-of-stock item if Target, in its sole discretion, determines that the identical brand and product is available in a form that is of equal or greater value, for example, larger quantity, packaged with a trial sample, or with updated product packaging.

Target’s acknowledgement of an order means that your order request has been received; it does not mean that your order has been accepted or shipped or that the price or availability of an item has been confirmed. Target makes a conscientious effort to describe and display its products and services accurately on the Site. Despite these efforts, a small number of items on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information on the Site and in our advertising on other sites. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability and services, including for items sold by Target Plus Partners. Target, or Target Plus Partners, reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies or omissions at any time without prior notice.

DMCA Notice - Notice & Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement
Target’s policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Copyright-infringing materials found on the Site can be identified and removed via our process listed below, and you agree to comply with such process in the event you are involved in any claim of copyright infringement to which the DMCA may be applicable.

If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Target’s copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying Target that your copyrighted material has been infringed. Target does not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, Target will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. Target may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, Target is required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content ("Alleged Infringer"). The Alleged Infringer is allowed under the law to send Target a counter-notification. Notices and counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular Site activities or communications. We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.

To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by fax, regular mail, or email only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.


A DMCA notice must:

Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, "My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location where material is located].");
Identify the Content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Site. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;
Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);
If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);
Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law";
Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed";
Be signed; and
Be sent to our DMCA designated agent at the following address:

WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTS OF NEW JERSEY, TARGET OR ITS EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, OR ANY MATERIALS THEREIN UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARE THE RESULT OF TARGET’S NEGLIGENT, FRAUDULENT OR RECKLESS ACTS OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND TARGET. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND TARGET. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE(S).

Indemnification & Defense
As a condition of the use of the Site, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Target and its respective employees, directors, officers, agents, vendors and suppliers from and against any liabilities, losses, investigations, inquiries, claims, suits, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (each, a "Claim") arising out of or otherwise relating to Claims alleging facts that if true would constitute a breach by you of these Terms & Conditions, or any User Content submitted by you.

Arbitration Agreement
Please read this section carefully. Except as the Terms & Conditions otherwise provide, you waive your rights to try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in any class, collective, or other representative action.

Agreement to Binding Arbitration
You and Target agree that in the event of any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with (1) the site or (2) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, application, or validity of these Terms & Conditions, such claim, dispute or controversy will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms & Conditions (the “Arbitration Agreement”).

Exceptions to Arbitration
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or Target can bring an individual claim in small claims court in the United States of America consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim; and (2) you agree that you or Target may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

Jury Trial & Class Action Waiver
Except as the Terms & Conditions otherwise provide, you and Target acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and Target may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim.

If any court or arbitrator determines that any term in the immediately preceding paragraph is unenforceable for any reason as to any claim, then the Arbitration Agreement will be inapplicable to that claim, and that claim will instead proceed through litigation in court rather than by arbitration, but only after the conclusion of the arbitration of any claim or dispute that is subject to the Arbitration Agreement.

Governing Law & Arbitration Rules
The Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. If the FAA is found not to apply to any issue that arises under this section or the enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of Minnesota.

The arbitration will be conducted under the then current and applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

Initiating Arbitration
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send a written notice (“Notice”), by first class or certified mail to Target.com Guest Services, P.O. Box 9350, Minneapolis, MN 55440-9350. If Target intends to seek arbitration, Target will send a Notice to the current billing address on your account. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim and the specific relief sought. If the parties cannot reach an agreement within 30 days from the receipt of the Notice, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings.

A form to initiate arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send such copy to Target at Target Law Department, 1000 Nicollet Mall, TPS-3155, Minneapolis, MN 55403, and Target will send such copy to the current billing address on your account or to your attorney, if you have retained one.

Fees
For claims of $100,000 (US Dollars) or less, Target will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, “Filing Fees”) unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. For claims over $100,000 (US Dollars), you will be responsible for the Filing Fees.

Location & Procedure
If your claim is for $10,000 (US Dollars) or less, you may choose to have arbitration conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephone hearing, by an in-person hearing in the county of your residence, or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. If your claim exceeds $10,000 (US Dollars), the location of the arbitration and the parties’ right to a hearing will be determined in accordance with the rules of the AAA.

Arbitrator’s Decision
The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Target waives its right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration.

Choice of Law, Forum Selection, & Jury Waiver
Except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement section above, all matters relating to your access to or use of the site and all matters arising out of or related to these Terms & Conditions, will be governed by the applicable laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to Minnesota’s choice of law principles. Unless you and Target agree otherwise, in the event that it is determined or these Terms & Conditions provide that a claim should not proceed through arbitration, you agree that any claim or dispute (with the exception of a claim or dispute appropriately lodged in any small claims court in the United States of America) shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. If subject matter jurisdiction (including diversity jurisdiction) does not exist in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota for any such claim, then the exclusive forum and venue for any such action shall be the courts of the State of Minnesota located in Hennepin County, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. As to any proceeding in court, you and Target both waive your right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable.

The choice-of-law and forum-selection provisions in this section do not apply to the Arbitration Agreement or to any arbitrable disputes as provided by the Arbitration Agreement section. Instead, as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, the FAA shall apply to any such disputes.

Miscellaneous
These Terms & Conditions, including policies and information linked from or incorporated herein or otherwise found on the Site, constitute the entire agreement between you and Target with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements, and proposals with respect to the Site. No provision of these Terms & Conditions shall be waived except pursuant to a writing executed by the party against whom the waiver is sought. No failure to exercise, partial exercise of, or delay in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms & Conditions shall operate as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. Except as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, if any provision of these Terms & Conditions is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired. You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms & Conditions without our express prior written consent. We will not be responsible for failure to fulfill any obligation due to causes beyond our control.

Yahoo Connected TV Developer Terms of Use
 
A. Yahoo Connected TV Developer Terms of Use

This Yahoo Connected TV Developer Terms of Use (“Developer TOU”) sets forth terms and conditions, additional to the Yahoo Terms of Service (“TOS”), that govern your access to and use of the Yahoo Connected TV Platform (the “Platform”). This Developer TOU and TOS, together with any additional terms, addendums, or documents that may be referenced therein (collectively, “Agreement”), form the entire agreement between you and Oath Holdings Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Yahoo”) in connection with the Platform. By using any portion of the Platform, you accept the terms of this Agreement on your own behalf, or on behalf of the company, organization, or other legal entity for whom you use the Platform to develop or distribute TV Apps. If you disagree with any of the provisions in this Agreement, then Yahoo does not grant you permission to use the Platform or to license to any portion thereof. Yahoo may update and change this Agreement at any time without notice to you; your access to and/or use of the Platform after any such change means you accept such change.

Capitalized terms not defined in this Developer TOU have the meaning ascribed to them in the TOS. Certain defined terms in this Developer TOU are included in the definitions of capitalized terms in the TOS, as follows: (a) the Platform is a Yahoo Service; accordingly, all references in the Agreement to Yahoo Service incorporate by reference the Platform, and (b) each TV App, together with related material (including but not limited to links, metadata, markup, information, trademarks, service marks, audio files, audio visual files, art, graphics, images, programming, video, third-party material, and other assets), is Content; accordingly, all references to Content in this Agreement incorporate by reference your TV Apps and related material. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Developer TOU and the TOS, the terms of the Developer TOU shall control. The imposition of additional enumerated restrictions or liabilities on your actions or omissions, by one document over the other, shall not be considered in and of itself a conflict. At any time you can review the most current version of the Developer TOU at https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/product-atos/connectedtvdeveloper/index.html and the most current version of the TOS at https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/utos/index.html.

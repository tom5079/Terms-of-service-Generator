content displayed by, stored on or accessed through your Device belong to the respective content
owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and

the extent that the Apple Software accesses any Third Party Apps, Apple has no express or implied
obligation to provide any technical or other support for such Third Party Apps. Please contact the
appropriate software vendor, manufacturer or service provider directly for technical support and
customer service related to its software, service, website and/or products. YOU AGREE YOU SHALL BE

TERMS FOR EACH THIRD PARTY APP USED BY THE SHORTCUT. APPLE DOES NOT GUARANTEE IN
ANY WAY THAT SHORTCUTS COMPLY WITH THE TERMS FOR ANY THIRD PARTY APPS AND APPLE
IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY SHORTCUTS.

with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Apple Software and Services. Features of the Apple Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be

and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Apple for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.

example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By 
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Apple Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Apple Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer
must include your Device and all of the Apple Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Apple Software, full or partial, including copies stored on
a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Apple Software reads and agrees to

identifiers for your Device are sent to Apple in order to allow others to reach you by your phone number
when using various communication features of the Apple Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Apple may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Apple and how the

Center, iCloud, Maps and other Apple and third party services and web sites (collectively and
individually, “Services”). Such Services may not be available in all languages or in all countries. Use of
these Services requires Internet access and use of certain Services may require an Apple ID, may require
you to accept additional terms and may be subject to additional fees. By using this software in
connection with an Apple ID, or other Apple Service, you agree to the applicable terms of service for that
Service, such as the latest Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions for the country in which you
access such Services, which you may access and review at https://www.apple.com/legal/internetservices/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Photos”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums”, “Back Up” and “Find My iPhone” may be accessed directly from the Apple Software. You
acknowledge and agree that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and
conditions of the iCloud service, which you may access and review at: https://www.apple.com/legal/
internet-services/icloud/.
(c) News App Content. Your use of content accessed through the News application is limited solely to
personal, noncommercial use, does not transfer any ownership interest to you in the content, and
specifically excludes, without limitation, any commercial or promotional use rights in such content.
Furthermore, you are prohibited from republishing, retransmitting and reproducing any images accessed
through News as a stand-alone file.
(d) Maps. The maps service and features of the Apple Software (“Maps”), including map data coverage,
may vary by region. When you use any location-based features within Maps, such as turn-by-turn
navigation, traffic and local search, various location-related and usage information may be sent to Apple,
including the real-time geographic location of your Device, in order to process your request and help
improve Maps. Such location and usage data is collected by Apple in a form that does not personally 
identify you. By using Maps, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’
transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, to provide and
improve the Maps features and service, and other Apple products and services. Apple may also
provide such information, in either an aggregated or non personally identifiable form, to its partners and
licensees to help improve their map and location-based products and services. You may disable the
location-based functionality of Maps by going to the Location Services setting on your Device and
turning off the individual location setting for Maps. Certain Maps features will however be unavailable if
you disable the Location Services setting, such as turn-by-turn navigation.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Apple, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Apple is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Apple, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you
(g) Neither Apple nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Apple Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. You agree that, the results you receive
from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can affect the
accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions, and
geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to posted
road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and note
that walking directions may not include sidewalks or pedestrian paths.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Apple, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Apple. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit 
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Apple is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed, linked to or displayed on the
Device are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Apple makes no representation
that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular
location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials, you do so
at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not
limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through
your Device may cause metadata, including where and when the photo was taken, and depth
information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of Apple services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to
share or sync such photos will involve Apple receiving and storing such metadata. Apple and its
licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time
without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such
Services. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and
without notice or liability
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate
automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any
term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Apple
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE

Additionally, in order to send or receive person to person payments, you must have an Apple Pay Cash
card.
Supported Payment Cards and person to person payments are associated with the Apple ID you have
signed into iCloud to use these features. Supported Cards are only available to individuals aged 13 years
or older, and may be subject to additional age-based restrictions imposed by iCloud or the Supported
Card which you are trying to provision. The Apple Pay Cash card and the ability to send and receive
person to person payments are only available to individuals aged 18 years or older.
Apple Pay is intended for your personal use and you may only provision your own Supported Cards. If
you are provisioning a supported corporate card, you represent that you are doing so with the
authorization of your employer and you are authorized to bind your employer to these terms of use and
all transactions effected by use of this feature. If you are sending or receiving a person to person
payment, you represent that you are doing so for your own personal, non-commercial use.
You agree not to use Apple Pay for illegal or fraudulent purposes, or any other purposes which are
prohibited by the License and these Supplemental Terms. You further agree to use Apple Pay in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. You agree not to interfere with or disrupt the Apple Pay
service (including accessing the service through any automated means), or any servers or networks
connected to the service, or any policies, requirements, or regulations of networks connected to the
service (including any unauthorized access to, use, or monitoring of data or traffic thereon).
2. Apple’s Relationship With You
Apple Pay enables you to create a virtual representation of your Supported Cards on your supported
Device. However Apple does not process payments or other non-payment card transactions (such as
reward accrual and redemption), receive, hold, or transfer your funds, or have any other control over
payments, returns, refunds, rewards, value, discounts, or other commerce activity that may arise out of
your use of this feature.
The terms of cardholder agreements you may have in place with your card issuer will continue to govern
your use of your Supported Cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay. Similarly, your
participation in any merchant rewards or gift card programs and your use of Apple Pay-Enabled Cards in
connection with Apple Pay will be subject to such merchant’s terms and conditions.
The Apple Pay Cash card and the ability to send and receive person to person payments are only
available in the United States, and are services provided by Green Dot Bank, member FDIC. When you
enable these features within Apple Pay, you are opening an account with Green Dot Bank, and when you
send or receive a person to person payment or load or withdraw money from your Apple Pay Cash card,
Green Dot Bank will be responsible for receiving and sending your money to the intended recipient. The
financial institution responsible for offering Apple Pay Cash and person to person payments within Apple
Pay is subject to change, and your use of such features are subject to their terms and conditions.
Nothing in the License or these Supplemental Terms modifies the terms of any cardholder, user, or
merchant agreement, and such terms will govern your use of the applicable Supported Card or the
person to person payment feature of Apple Pay and their virtual representation on your Device. You
agree that Apple is not a party to your cardholder or merchant agreements, nor is Apple responsible for
the: (a) content, accuracy or unavailability of any payment cards, rewards cards, gift cards, commerce
activities, transactions, or purchases while using Apple Pay functionality; (b) issuance of credit or 
assessing eligibility for credit; (c) accrual or redemption of rewards or stored value under a merchant’s
program; (d) funding or reloading of prepaid cards; (e) sending or receiving of person to person
payments; or (f) loading, redeeming, or withdrawing money from your Apple Pay Cash card.
For all disputes or questions about payment cards, rewards cards, gift cards, or associated commerce
activity, please contact your issuer or the applicable merchant. For questions regarding the Apple Pay
Cash card or person to person payments, please contact Apple Support.
3. Privacy
Apple Pay requires some information from your Device in order to offer the full experience. Additionally,
when you use your Apple Pay Cash card or send or receive person to person payments, additional
information about your transactions is collected and retained to service your account and fraud
prevention and regulatory purposes. You can find more information on the data collected, used, or
shared as part of your use of Apple Pay, the Apple Pay Cash card, or person to person payments with
Apple Pay by reading About Apple Pay and Privacy (which can be accessed by going to Wallet & Apple
Pay on your Device, or within the Watch app on a paired Device) or by visiting https://www.apple.com/
privacy. By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’
transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all of the foregoing information, to provide
Apple Pay functionality.
4. Security; Lost or Disabled Devices
Apple Pay stores virtual representations of your Supported Cards and should be protected as you would
protect cash or your physical credit, debit, prepaid, rewards, or gift cards. Providing your Device
passcode to a third party or allowing a third party to add their fingerprint to use Touch ID or enable Face
ID may result in their ability to make payments, send, request, or receive person to person payments,
withdraw money from your Apple Pay Cash card, or receive or redeem rewards or credit using Apple Pay
on your Device. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Device and of your
passcode. You agree that Apple does not have any responsibility if you lose or share access to your
Device. You agree that Apple does not have any responsibility if you make unauthorized modifications to
the Apple Software (such as by way of a “jailbreak”).
You may need to enable additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication for your Apple
ID, in order to access particular features of Apple Pay, including the Apple Pay Cash card and person to
person payments with Apple Pay. If you subsequently remove those security features, you may not be
able to continue to access particular features of Apple Pay.
If your Device is lost or stolen and you have Find My iPhone enabled, you can use Find My iPhone to
attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Payment Cards or sending person to
person payments on that Device by putting it into Lost Mode. You can also erase your Device, which will
attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Payment Cards or send person to
person payments on the Device and will also attempt to remove the Apple Pay-Enabled Cards. You
should also contact the issuer of your Supported Payment Cards, the merchant who issued your Apple
Pay-Enabled Cards, and Apple in the case of your Apple Pay Cash card in order to prevent unauthorized
access to your Supported Cards.
If you report or Apple suspects fraudulent or abusive activity, you agree to cooperate with Apple in any
investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe.
5. Limitation of Liability
IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN
THE LICENSE, APPLE DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR PURCHASES, PAYMENTS,
TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHER COMMERCE ACTIVITY MADE USING THE APPLE PAY FEATURE, AND
YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO AGREEMENTS YOU MAY HAVE WITH YOUR CARD ISSUER,
PAYMENT NETWORK, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, OR MERCHANT TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OR
DISPUTES RELATING TO YOUR SUPPORTED CARDS, PERSON TO PERSON PAYMENTS, AND
ASSOCIATED COMMERCE ACTIVITY.

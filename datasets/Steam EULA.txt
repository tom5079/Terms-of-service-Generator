The provisions of this Limited Warranty are valid in the United States and Canada only.

OTHER THAN EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE GAME SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

Personal Information and Choice
Under the Information Practices Act, “personal information” is information that “identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history.” Under the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, “personal information” is information that identifies an individual, including an individual’s photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address (but not the 5-digit zip code), telephone number, and medical or disability information. Information regarding official government actions relating to a person’s driving privilege, such as records of convictions, driving violations, accidents, driver’s status, driver license suspensions, and revocations of the driving privilege, are open to public inspection under Vehicle Code section 1808 and are not a driver’s “personal information.”  A domain name or Internet Protocol address is also not considered personal information, however, it is considered "electronically collected personal information".

According to Government Code § 11015.5, "Electronically collected personal information" means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a state agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.  “Electronically collected personal information” does not include DMV’s receipt of the following information: conviction information received from the courts, accidents, a suspension or revocation of the driving privilege, or other official actions pertaining to the driving privilege.

"Electronically collected personal information" we automatically collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e. completing a request for assistance, personalizing the content of the web site, sending an e-mail or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the web site.

Information that is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user may be a public record subject to public inspection and copying once you provide it unless it is otherwise protected by federal or state law.

Additionally, departments and agencies of the State of California are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which is also accessible on this web site. Please see Department of General Services Management Memo 00-14, effective January 1, 2001.

A Special Note About Children
Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to the State as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a minor you should seek guidance from your parents or guardians.

If the state decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use for it. The state will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child's information and, if they choose, prohibit the state from making further use of their child's information. The state will not provide personal information about children to third parties.
